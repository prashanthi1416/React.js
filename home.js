            <h1>Home_Component</h1>
            <p>Thanks for your suggestion. That seems to work thanks.
                 I'm always keen to avoid hardcoding widths in the styles 
                 so is there anyway to avoid doing the calc(100%-109px)? 
                 If the size of the icon were to change, then this style 
                 would break</p>
        </div>
    )
}
export default FirstExample;
